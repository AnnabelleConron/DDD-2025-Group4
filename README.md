## Abstract
This project reframes UFO sighting records as a speculative tourism guide for alien “species.” By analysing where each craft-shape appears most often and mapping contextual state indicators, we create radar charts that imagine how extraterrestrial travellers might choose their next destination.

## What topic does the project address?
The project explores how contextual, terrestrial data can reshape interpretations of UFO sightings. Using a speculative framing, it examines how state-level environmental, social, and cultural indicators can be reimagined as factors influencing alien movement and destination preference.

## What data did we consider?
We combined NUFORC UFO sighting records with state-based variables: average temperature, political leaning, fast-food density, crime rates, and other tourism-relevant indicators (parks, cultural venues, hazards). For each species, we identified its top three states by sighting frequency.

## What does the visualisation show?
The visualisation presents species-specific radar charts where each axis represents one of the top three states and each variable adds a comparative layer. The charts function as “decision compasses,” illustrating the contextual landscape that might influence an alien species’ preferred destinations.
